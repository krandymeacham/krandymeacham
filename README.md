- 👋 Hi, I’m @Randymeacham
- 👀 I’m interested in in many things, but things I try to narrow it down to is utlizing data and technology to impact healthcare affordability, finance, and help cure childhood disease in my current role at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and implementing the Databricks platform (on Azure) to transition many of our ETL workflows from ADF/EDW to the Delta Lake/Databricks. I'm also continuously improving my use of Python, SQL, and other tools to minimize memory consumption and effectively store and retrieve data. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything data or software engineering related to make this world a better place.
